This repository contains the code and supporting materials for my MSc dissertation at Trinity College Dublin. The project analyses operational performance on Dublinâ€™s Luas Red and Green Lines across four COVID-19 phases (Pre-COVID, Lockdown, Recovery, Post-COVID), using GTFS data and custom spatial visualisations. Key metrics include headway regularity, journey time volatility, and average duration. Figures generated from this code appear in the dissertation and its appendices.

### Archive

The `archive/` folder includes early-stage materials retained for transparency and data provenance:

- `background_info/`: Initial GTFS/TFI exploration notes and reference materials
- `periods/`: Raw GTFS logs separated by COVID-related service phases (pre-COVID, lockdown, etc.)
- `raw_forecast_logs.tsv`: Original full dataset used for early exploration
- `gtfs_load_exploration.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used to inspect and understand the GTFS `.tsv` structure

These files are not used in the final analysis pipeline but are preserved as part of the project's development history.
