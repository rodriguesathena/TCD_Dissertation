This repository contains the code and supporting materials for my MSc dissertation at Trinity College Dublin. The project analyses operational performance on Dublinâ€™s Luas Red and Green Lines across four COVID-19 phases (Pre-COVID, Lockdown, Recovery, Post-COVID), using GTFS data and custom spatial visualisations. Key metrics include headway regularity, journey time volatility, and average duration. Figures generated from this code appear in the dissertation and its appendices.
